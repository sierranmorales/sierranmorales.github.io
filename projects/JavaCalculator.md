This project is a calculator that preforms power, factorial, and summation calculations using recursive methods. It also contains an interactive GUI. All of this is programmed in Java without the use of outside libraries or frameworks.

This project was memorable to me because it was the first (and only) time that I have created a GPU uising Java.
