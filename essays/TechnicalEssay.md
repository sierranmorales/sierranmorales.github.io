  In the field of software engineering, asking smart questions is an essential skill. According to “How to ask questions the smart way,”  smart questions are specific, clear, and well thought out. They use meaningful subject headers, are easy to reply to, and are written in clear and grammatically-correct language. Asking smart questions can help software engineers get better answers and solve problems more efficiently and effectively. It will also inspire people to be more helpful to you than if you were to ask poorer questions. This is particularly important in a field like software engineering, where complex technical issues often arise, and where collaboration and communication are key to success. By asking smart questions, software engineers can demonstrate their competence, gain the respect of their peers, and advance their knowledge and careers.

	An example of a smart question that was posted to stack overflow can be found -----------. The user got an error saying “Missing ‘use strict’ statement,” and after implementing the statement, was wondering what it meant. The user mentioned that they had done some searching on Google, but to no effect. The question is phrased intelligently and uses correct grammar and syntax. It also presents the different segments of the question in chronological order.
Because of the “smart” phrasing of the question, there were many helpful replies with both  personal experiences as well as linked resources. This question was up-voted by 8422 people, indicating that the question “shows research effort [and] it is useful and clear.”

An example of a "bad" question on Stack Overflow can be found -------
<br>
The question starts with “It's late, I'm tired and forgot I had java homework,” which implies that the user did not put much effort or thought into finding the answer themselves beforehand. The user then goes on to list a homework problem and ask people to help them solve it.
<br>
	This is an example of a “bad question” because unlike the example above, it does not show any personal effort or thought. It is also not fully grammatically correct in its phrasing. The responses mimic the effort of the question with one person replying “What exactly is your question?,” and another saying “To me "I forgot I had homework" is just another way of saying "I put off doing my homework until the last minute". Neither get my sympathy vote.”
<br>
	In conclusion, asking smart questions is a crucial skill for anyone seeking to learn and solve problems effectively. By following the guidelines outlined in “How to ask questions the smart way,” we can improve our ability to ask clear, specific, and well thought out questions. This can help us get better answers, solve problems more effectively, and ultimately achieve our goals. So next time you have a question, take a moment to think about how you can ask it in a smart way.
