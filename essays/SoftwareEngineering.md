  My first introduction to Software Engineering was a “Web Applications Development” class that I took in my junior year of high school. I didn’t quite know what “Web Applications Development” meant, but it sounded more interesting 
than the other elective options. It was only when I finally attended the first class that I realized that we were going to be “coding,” something that I had only heard of before. From the moment that I wrote my first "Hello World" program 
in that class, I was hooked. And moving beyond a mere “Hello World,” the process of converting a nebulous idea into a tangible, functioning application offers a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that is unmatched. But beyond 
the coding, what truly excites me about software engineering is its ubiquitous impact on the world—from automating mundane tasks to solving complex problems in healthcare, finance, and beyond. The field offers an unprecedented blend of 
creative problem-solving, analytical thinking, and direct societal impact.

As I continue to explore software engineering, my interest is currently fixed on neural networks and operating systems. Neural networks particularly captivated my attention through my current research project, “Find Supernovae,” which 
uses AI to identify supernovae in images from the Hubble Space Telescope. This work is not only intellectually stimulating but has also led me to delve into deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, further nourishing my enthusiasm for AI. 
<br><br>

Concurrently, I'm taking an Operating Systems class that, while challenging, has been incredibly rewarding. Operating systems form the foundational bedrock upon which all software solutions are built. The course has illuminated the
intricacies of OS-level processes and has deepened my understanding of hardware-software interaction. By focusing on these diverse yet complementary domains, I aim to develop a skill set that merges high-level computational thinking 
with a robust understanding of the underlying systems, equipping me to contribute meaningfully to a broad array of software engineering challenges.
<br><br>

While I am still exploring and remain uncertain about the specific subfield of software engineering that I want to specialize in, I intend to find my niche and excel within it, while contributing meaningfully to the broader 
software engineering landscape.
