<h4>
	Introduction
</h4>
ICS 414 is a project based course where students work in teams to develop a product for a client. In my case, I was working in a team of eight to develop a website 
for an organization called “The Voluntree”, a resource that connects volunteers with volunteering opportunities. This project not only challenged me to apply my technical 
knowledge in a practical environment, but also taught me the importance of effective collaboration and communication within a team. Ultimately, this experience has helped
me hone both my technical and soft skills essential for a successful career in software engineering.

<h4>
	Teamwork
</h4>
Perhaps the most valuable takeaway from this course was the hands-on experience of working with a larger team. Prior to this project, my experience in team-based development 
was limited to a smaller-scale project in ICS 314, where I worked within a smaller group. Transitioning into working in a team of eight presented both challenges and learning 
opportunities. Initially, organizing and synchronizing with a larger team proved challenging, especially as we all had varying schedules. Each member also brought different 
skill sets and workstyles, requiring us to find effective ways to integrate our efforts. We used tools like GitHub for version control and to facilitate aspects of team coordination 
such as issue and milestone tracking, and code review. Using these tools and processes was challenging at first, but they provided me with an expanded and valuable understanding of 
how larger development teams manage their complexities. Through this course, I learned the importance of communication and the role of structured processes in a successful development team.

<h4>
	Technical Skills
</h4>
Besides the valuable lessons in teamwork, this class also allowed me to further develop my web development skills. From this course, I have become a lot more comfortable working 
with larger-scale projects, in which there are many different files working together. I had to adapt as we grew our codebase more and more, and I learned to implement features 
that I never have before. I also became a lot more comfortable with the intelliJ IDEA IDE. I got to know the intricacies and hotkeys which allow me to more easily traverse the 
codebase (my favorite is shift-shift to search through everything). I think a portion of this course that was more helpful to me than I initially thought was the weekly code reviews. 
Analyzing other people’s code and critiquing it against a standard checklist really helped to develop and polish my own code. I also learned how to take criticism and apply 
it towards improving my work.

<h4>
	Future Applications
</h4>
The skills gained and polished in this course will surely be valuable in my future career as a programmer. Almost all development jobs are team-based, so having hands-on experience 
working with a group on a real project before I graduate will certainly be helpful for preparing me to enter the workforce. It is also good to add a project like this to my resume.
<br>
 
 In the future, I anticipate that the practical knowledge of GitHub and collaborative tools will be valuable in almost any tech environment. Additionally, my practice analyzing and 
 critiquing code during our weekly reviews has sharpened my eye for detail and will enhance my ability to maintain higher code quality standards in future professional settings. 
 After taking ICS 414, I also feel much more confident in my web development skills, which broadens the types of jobs I can do after graduation.

<br><br>

<h4>
	Conclusion
</h4>
In conclusion, ICS 414 has been an extremely valuable experience that has significantly enriched my understanding of software development within a team environment. 
This course allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in a real-world setting, while also emphasizing the importance of collaboration and communication. The skills that 
I have acquired and honed in ICS 414 have helped to prepare me for a successful career in software engineering.
