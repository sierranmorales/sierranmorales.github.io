<br /><br />
  Design patterns in software engineering are like the blueprints in architecture, providing standardized solutions to common problems in software design. They are the frameworks 
  that programmers can use to tackle complex problems by applying proven strategies, much like how architects use blueprints to guide their building designs. There are many different design patterns. 
  Among these, the Observer, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and Singleton patterns are particularly noteworthy. Each pattern offers a unique approach to solving specific software design challenges, 
  much like specialized tools in an architect's toolkit. 
<br /><br />

<h4>
	Observer
</h4>
In the Observer pattern, think of the prompter in a theater. The prompter's role is to alert actors to their cues, much like how the Observer pattern works in software. 
Each actor (or 'observer') is attentive to specific cues from the prompter (the 'subject'). When a cue is given, the actors react accordingly. In my coding, I've used this pattern for 
event handling systems. Just like a prompter cues an actor, an event-handling system notifies various parts of the application when a particular event (like a user input) occurs. Another example of a
similar pattern to the Observer pattern, is the Publish-Subscribe pattern, which I have used within the Meteor framework.
<br /><br />


<h4>
	MVC (Model View Controller)
</h4>
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is like the structure of your play production. The script (the 'Model') holds the play's data and logic. The stage and scenery (the 'View')
present the script's content to the audience. And you, the director (the 'Controller'), interpret the script and instruct the stage on how to present the play. An example of how I 
have used this design pattern is within the Meteor framework. I have used a MongoDB database (the model) to hold the data on the backend, and React (the view) to present an accessible user interface.
<br /><br />

<h4>
	Singleton
</h4>
Finally, the Singleton pattern can be likened to the role of a theater manager. There's only one manager for the theater, overseeing critical operations. In software, the Singleton pattern ensures 
that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In my coding experience, I've used Singleton in the form of global 'collections' in my Meteor applications. Only one instance 
of this collection class is created and accessible to the rest of the application. 
<br /><br />

<h4>
	In Conclusion
</h4>
Design patterns are invaluable in software development, offering standardized solutions for common challenges. Patterns like Observer, MVC, and Singleton exemplify this: Observer facilitates responsive systems, 
MVC ensures separation of concerns for better maintainability, and Singleton efficiently manages shared resources. These patterns simplify complex codebases, enhance communication among developers with a 
shared language, and prevent reinventing the wheel for each project. In essence, design patterns are fundamental to creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable software, making them crucial 
for any proficient software developer.
