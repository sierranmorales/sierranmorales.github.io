<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
  The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has been steadily growing in importance over the past few years, and it holds significant relevance to the field of Software Engineering. 
  AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach, learn, and practice software engineering, making it more effective, efficient, and adaptable to the evolving needs of the industry. 
  <br>

  While not perfect, AI has become an exceedingly helpful learning tool for me, both within the scope of ICS 314, and elsewhere. AI can be used for things like code generation, debugging, and my favorite, 
  personalized learning. I have gotten the most use out of ChatGPT, mostly using it to explain specific concepts in a way that I find easiest to understand. I have also used ChatGPT to help debug code I have written,
  both for ICS 314 assignments, and for my research.

<h2>Personal Experience with AI</h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h5>Experience WODs e.g. E18</h5>
		<p>
		I have not used AI for any of the experience WODs. Since the purpose of them is primarily to prepare you for the in-class WODs, and since they are graded based on participation rather than result,
		I found it more beneficial to use the resources provided to do the experience WODs, rather than relying on AI for help.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>In-class Practice WODs</h5>
		<p>I did try to use ChatGPT for one of the in-class practice WODs in an attempt to fix an issue I had encountered, but it was not very helpful.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>In-class WODs</h5>
		<p>
		I did use ChatGPT for help with some of the earlier in-class WODs. I stopped trying to use ChatGPT once we started using different frameworks like React and Meteor, rather than JSFiddle.
		It became easier for me to debug code within multiple files on my own. My use of ChatGPT consisted of writing code to the best of my ability within the time frame given, copying and pasting it into ChatGPT for final 			debugging, and implementing the suggested changes. This was surprisingly effective and helped me complete one or two WODs that I may not have otherwise.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Essays</h5>
		<p>
		I did not use AI for any of the essays. Many of the prompts were related to personal experiences or opinions, which are unable to be generated by AI.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Final project</h5>
		<p>
		I have not yet used AI for our final project. I have not encountered any issues that I was unable to solve fairly easily, and I find it easier to generate this type of code by hand, 
		rather than with the use of AI.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Learning a concept / tutorial</h5>
		<p>
		This is one of my favorite uses of ChatGPT. I have used it many times to explain concepts to me in various ways, sometimes using fun analogies (for example, “explain xyz in terms of minecraft,” or 
		“explain like you’re talking to a child”). From memory, one of the most helpful examples of this from ICS 314 is when I used it to help guide me in the setup of npm. I had to reroute the PATH, and 
		I would have had a lot more difficulty figuring it out without the help from ChatGPT.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Answering a question in class or in Discord</h5>
		<p>
		The only thing similar to this that I have done is assisting a friend who is in a different section of ICS 314 with an issue that I knew how to solve due to previous knowledge gained from ChatGPT.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Asking or answering a smart-question</h5>
		<p>
		I suppose I have asked ChatGPT many “smart-questions”, many of which it has been helpful in answering. I have not used AI for any of the ICS 314 “smart-question” assignments. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”</h5>
		<p>
		I have definitely used ChatGPT to give coding examples or syntax references. I generally find it more helpful to look up documentation first, but AI can be helpful with catering to more specific 
		circumstances or needs.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Explaining code</h5>
		<p>
		I have not used AI to explain code to me, though I have used it to provide examples as mentioned above. Usually if I am reading code that I don’t fully understand, there will be an explanation or comment nearby.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Writing code</h5>
		<p>
		I have not used AI to write code, only to help debug code I have already written.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Documenting code</h5>
		<p>
		I have not used ChatGPT to document code. I would rather document as I go.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”</h5>
		<p>
		I have asked ChatGPT “What’s wrong with this code:...” as a debugging aid. I usually try to fix it on my own for a bit first, but it can be helpful in finding things that 
		I may have missed. I have not used it to fix formatting errors or anything like that.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h5>
		<p>
		I can’t think of any other uses of AI in ICS 314.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>



<h2>Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2><br>
  AI has been extremely helpful in my learning experience and skill development. I find it to be a great resource to help explain intricate or specific concepts. I think as long as you don’t rely on AI, 
  but instead use it as a supplemental tool, it can be extremely beneficial. I think AI has enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts in the sense that it has helped me to gain a deeper 
  understanding of certain concepts that I would have otherwise not known about. 
  <br>

  I will say; I am extremely grateful that I went through elementary through high school and early college without access to AI resources like ChatGPT. I feel that since I was able to develop necessary skills like 
  writing and mathematics before being able to access AI, that I am able to better use it as an accessory to learning, rather than as a crutch.
<br><br>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2><br>
  I have incorporated AI, mostly ChatGPT, into various aspects of my life outside of ICS 314. For example if I have a specific or contextual question and am unable to find an acceptable answer on the web, 
  I will ask ChatGPT.
  <br>

  I also have used ChatGPT a lot to help me with my research project. I use it for help with debugging, as well as with learning how to properly apply certain concepts within astronomical data processing. 
  I would have a hard time and probably be much more reliant on my mentor without the help of ChatGPT.
<br><br>

<h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2><br>
  I have encountered many limitations of AI within this course, as well as in other areas. It can be extremely helpful in certain circumstances, but it is really better as a supplemental source of knowledge 
  rather than a baseline. It is really not THAT good (yet). I have caught it many times making small mistakes or errors, sometimes, not-so-small mistakes. Within the context of ICS 314, it is not that helpful 
  for most of the course, especially when you are dealing with programs that contain multiple files. 
  <br>

  That being said, I do think that AI can be an extremely helpful tool in software engineering education, but I think it is important that the primary skills and knowledge are developed before
  AI is integrated as an accessory.
<br><br>

<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2><br>
  I think ideally, AI-enhanced teaching methods should be just an upgrade on traditional teaching methods, keeping the same principals, but adding new resources. I think one important feature of AI-enhanced
  learning is that it allows for a more personalized experience that traditional methods often are unable to provide. 
  <br>

  I do worry about engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development in the context of AI-enhanced learning. It is very easy to rely on AI, rather than learn from AI. I think if used mindfully, 
  AI can help improve all of the topics listed above, but it can also be a detriment if  it leads to overdependence and a decrease in critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The key is to balance 
  the use of AI as a tool for enhancing learning, rather than replacing the foundational skills and thought processes that are essential for deep understanding and application of knowledge.
<br><br>

<h2>Future Considerations</h2><br>
  The future of AI is difficult to gauge, especially in the context of software engineering education. I think all of the things that I mentioned above are going to be applicable, 
  at least for a while. That being said, with the rate at which AI is advancing, I am concerned how it will impact not just software engineering education, but also software engineering as a field, 
  and even the rest of society. In its current state, AI is still imprecise and wrought with issues, but it is possible that these problems may become obsolete. In that case perhaps software engineering 
  education will become less about learning how to program, and more about learning how to implement AI resources in the context of a software engineering environment.
<br><br>



<h2>In Conclusion</h2><br>
  AI has significantly influenced my journey in software engineering education, offering both profound benefits, and notable challenges. Its role as a supplementary tool has enriched my understanding of complex concepts, 
  allowing me to explore areas of software engineering with a depth and clarity that might have otherwise been unattainable. The personalization and flexibility offered by AI, particularly ChatGPT, have 
  provided invaluable support in various applications, from research projects to everyday queries.
  <br>
  
  The balance between leveraging AI as an educational tool and maintaining a strong foundation in traditional learning methodologies is crucial. AI has the potential to enhance engagement, knowledge retention,
  and skill development, but it also has the potential to be harmful. The risk of dependency and erosion of critical thinking skills is real and must be carefully managed.
  <br>
  
  AI should serve as an ally in education, enhancing and complementing human capabilities, rather than becoming a substitute for the essential skills and critical thinking that form the bedrock 
  of software engineering knowledge.
