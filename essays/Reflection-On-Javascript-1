	My first introduction to programming was in my junior year of High School. Up until that point, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but I was sure that I was definitely not going to college. That was until I took a Web Applications Development class where we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At that point I fell in love. I knew that programming was going to be my path, and I still can’t see myself doing anything else. I guess you could say that the reason that I am here doing this is because of Javascript. 
	That being said, I hated it. I hated web development. I thought it was boring and tedious. The class was too slow for me, and had a focus on Web Development as a whole, which meant a lot of HTML and CSS. This had stained my view of Javascript. When the course website for this class was first provided to us, I read that it was focused around Javascript and I felt dread and disappointment. I was still excited to be able to code something, but why did it have to be dreaded web development.
	The first few classes and assignments have changed my mind. So far it is still not my favorite language, but I definitely view it in a more positive light now. I think how dynamic it can be is very convenient. Being able to treat functions as variables is very cool. ES6 was also interesting to me, as it is content that I have not covered before. I think that Javascript is a good programming language for its purposes, and while I still don’t like web development, I feel myself being swayed towards the dark side (of Javascript programming).
	The concept of “athletic software engineering” is not new to me, but I have never seen it called that before. I have practiced timed programming “problems” before. I do find them useful and I do think it helps me to learn. While I do find a degree of enjoyment from the WOD’s because I enjoy programming, I do also find them quite stressful.
